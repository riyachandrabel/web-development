    <h1>childhood</h1>
    <h2>why? because nothing is as beautiful as it was</h2>
    <p>when i was a kid, life was simple and beautiful, everything was so good back then and mind was so calm, happiness was in little things. when i grow up (at the age of 15-17) i started to realise that i need to get rich and started seeing dreams which feels unrealistic but that time i never feared of dreaming. because i thought everything is possible and achievable. nothing feels impossible. i was very competitive. i used to be happy in my own i didnot needed anyone to make me happy, i used to create my own happiness. </p><br>
    <h3>class 1st-2nd</h3>
    <p> at the age of 7-8 i decided to become pilot, when after sometime i got to know- sometimes plane get crashed and everyone of the plane dies. so i quit that dream.</p><br><hr>
    <h3>class 3rd-4th</h3>
    <p> at the age of 8-10 i decided to become doctor, by seeing my fathers sthetescope,he is pharmacist, but later got to know i requires lot of money, many lakhs, i was kid , i thought my parents cant afford to make me doctor, i was dumb </p><br><hr>
    <h3>class 5th</h3>
    <p> when i was in 5th std. i was very competitive. i took a challenge with my one of the close frnd of 5th class (lachhi) i told her i am going to get better score than you in this year and we both took this challenge. i took it so serious i didnt left any single topic or question because i didnot wanted to miss any marks. i always keep studying. i was working really hard . i come from school then go to tution class and just after returning i sit for study without resting or taking break. i justt miss that riya soooo muchhh, fortunately after doing hardwork i got 85% maybe in 5th std. the puropose of this challenge was to upgrade myself and keep myself motivated because i changed school in 4th std. and i got really bad percent for the first time in my life that was 64%. i had bad experience in my 4th std. but have many good experience because of aashi, and lachhi thanks to them for being my frnd when many other behaving like enemy. </p><br><hr>
    <h3>class 6th</h3>
    <p>from my 5th class i learned to do hardwork and hardwork can change your result definetly. in 6th std lachhi challenged me that she will get better marks than me. i accepted challenge and again i got better than her. and now working hard and stuying was in habit</p><br><hr>
    <h3>class 7th-the beautiful and heartbreaing as well</h3>
    <p>my 7th class is the best class and i have best memory of that time. if i could get a chance to go back to past i would choose the year "2014" i had a crush over a boy, i was completely in love with him. he was always in my mind but i used to study with focus as well. i was very brilliant now  i realise. i had capability of doing study and loving someone at the same time. i got 87% in 7th. best percent after class 3rd. because i was happy and studying. i lost my nana that year and i was very sad for that. i used to cry. i miss him so much. he was a great man and i can never find him again. we can never talk and laugh together, these things were feeling so different because it was the first time i lost my loving one. miss you nanaji </p><br><hr>
    <p>lets keep it till 7th class only.</p>
